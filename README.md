Stable Diffusion Project

**1. Project Overview**

**Project Title: ***Image Generation and Background Replacement using
Stable Diffusion*

**Description:**\
This project aims to implement an image generation and background
replacement pipeline using Stable Diffusion models within Google Colab.
The main objectives include:

-   Exploring multiple Stable Diffusion models, including Stable
    Diffusion 2.1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium.

-   Addressing hardware limitations, such as GPU memory issues, by
    applying optimizations like quantization and CPU offloading.

-   Replacing the background of an image with minimal manual
    intervention, such as auto-generating masks.

-   Overcoming compatibility and runtime issues with the HuggingFace
    Diffusers library.

**2. Project Execution**

**2.1 Model Selection**

**Explored Models:**

1.  Stable Diffusion 2.1: Initially used to address hardware constraints
    and test image generation workflows.

2.  Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium: A more advanced model, chosen due to
    hardware limitations preventing the use of the 3.5 Large model.

    -   Strengths: Higher quality outputs, improved text-to-image
        alignment, and efficient processing compared to 2.1.

    -   Challenges: Requires significant VRAM, leading to Out-Of-Memory
        (OOM) errors, resolved through quantization and CPU offloading.

  ----------------------------- ------------------------------------------------- ----------------------

***Note**: ****Due to GPU memory limitations (Colab Free tier), Stable
Diffusion 3.5 Large was skipped.*

**2.2 Addressing Memory Issues**

-   Encountered frequent Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors while running the
    models.

-   Implemented the following solutions:

    -   Quantization: Used BitsAndBytes to apply 4-bit quantization
        (NF4) to reduce VRAM usage.

    -   CPU Offloading: Mapped model components to both GPU and CPU
        using the device_map=\'balanced\' strategy.

    -   Environment Variables: Set
        PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to address CUDA
        memory fragmentation issues.

-   Initially tested workflows with Stable Diffusion 2.1 before scaling
    up to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium.

**3. Object Replacement and Background Replacement**

**Process:**

1.  Model Setup:

    -   Loaded the Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium model with optimizations.

    -   Enabled 4-bit quantization and CPU offloading to overcome VRAM
        issues.

1.  Mask Generation:

    -   Integrated an automated masking pipeline using text-based
        prompts to detect and mask objects.

```
1.  Background Replacement:

    -   Replaced the background of the masked object with a new
        generated image.

**4. Challenges and Solutions**

**1. Hardware Constraints:**

-   Issue: GPU memory (14.75 GB) on Colab Free tier was insufficient for
    Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large.

-   Solution: Used Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and applied 4-bit
    quantization and CPU offloading.

**2. Compatibility Issues:**

-   Issue: Errors due to new updates in the HuggingFace Diffusers
    library.

-   Solution: Resolved by referring to GitHub pull requests (e.g., ) and
    StackOverflow discussions.

**3. Gated Model Access:**

-   Issue: Access to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium was initially gated.

-   Solution: Gained access and successfully loaded model weights.

**5. Final Notes**

**Key Observations:**

-   Successfully implemented text-to-image generation and background
    replacement features.

-   Managed to optimize resource usage by leveraging quantized model
    weights and balanced CPU/GPU offloading.

-   Progressed from Stable Diffusion 2.1 to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium
    after addressing multiple memory and compatibility issues.

**Future Scope:**

-   Upgrade to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large using Colab Pro or alternative
    GPUs with higher VRAM.

-   Explore advanced masking techniques and additional adapters for
    improved object detection and background replacement.
